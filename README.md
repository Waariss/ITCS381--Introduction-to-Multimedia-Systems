## [Little Mouse Mini-Animation Project](https://github.com/Waariss/ITCS381--Introduction-to-Multimedia-Systems/tree/main/Mini-animation)
In the "Little Mouse" mini-animation project, I combined coding with creativity to bring a playful mouse to life. Users can interact in real-time: dragging along the X-axis changes the background color, while the mouse's eyes follow the cursor's movement. Clicking anywhere alters the mouse's hat color randomly, showcasing the blend of dynamic interactivity and visual design. This project not only honed my coding skills but also emphasized the importance of user interaction in animation.

## [Project DUB and SUB](https://github.com/Waariss/ITCS381--Introduction-to-Multimedia-Systems/tree/main/Project_Dub_SUb)
This project offers an option for users to select one of the videos and apply dubbing and subtitling to enhance the viewing experience.
